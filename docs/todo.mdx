#  TODO
* Batched queries:
 - Don't have db as a parameter when it's not even used
 - Have a non-batched option that can be used for transactions
* Update all return values in `cmd/static/loader/gen.gotmpl`  to return sanitised errors
* have config setting to specify copying of templates every gen time
* Allow modification of all the template files, like with gnorm
* Instead of map, use a structural, with a string array naming the fields that are provided or to be updated, to allow us to distinguish between 'no change' vs 'null this field'.
* Obfuscate cursor in pagination
* Simplify the config so that some parts (ModelPackageShort) can be automatically calculated when not provided
